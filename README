Image/IPTCInfo/RasterCaption version 0.01
=========================================

DESCRIPTION

Add to "Image::IPTCInfo" support for the IPTC IIM4 Dataset 2:125
Rasterized Caption.

This module sub-classes Josh Carter's "Image::IPTCInfo", and you should
consult the the Image::IPTCInfo manpage for details of how to use it
before proceding with this documentation.

BACKGROUND

The IPTC is the International Press & Telecommunications Council. The
IIM4 is version four of the Information Interchange Model, which amongst
other things allows the embedding of text (and now XML) within images
(though XML support is not yet provided by the Perl modules in this
namespace).

The IPTC IIM4 specification describes a rasterized caption as containing
"...the rasterized object data description and is used where characters
that have not been coded are required for the caption."

		Not repeatable, 7360 octets, consisting of binary data,one bit
		per pixel,two value bitmap where 1 (one) represents black and
		0 (zero) represents white.
